Jai Hind Everyone,
This is my project submission for the backend task, I've used NodeJS,ExpressJS to implement the logic while using the packages like nodemailer and Mailgen to get a template for the mail.

Here are some screenshots showing the layout of the basic frontend for this BACKEND project and the mail format.
